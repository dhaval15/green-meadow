# The Old Man And The Sea
##### Description
Santiago, an old Cuban fisherman, has gone 84 days without catching a fish. Confident that his bad luck is at an end, he sets off alone, far into the Gulf Stream, to fish. Santiagoâ€™s faith is rewarded, and he quickly hooks a marlin...a marlin so big he is unable to pull it in and finds himself being pulled by the giant fish for two days and two nights.
