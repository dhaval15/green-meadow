# Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret
##### Description
The iconic coming-of-age novel from the beloved author, Judy Blume, whose “name has long been synonymous with young adult fiction” (Los Angeles Times). Now a major motion picture starring Rachel McAdams and Kathy Bates! “Are You There God? It’s Me Margaret is very special.” —Amy Poehler (Vulture) “Generations of teenage girls have grown up reading the tales of teenage angst told by beloved author Judy Blume.” —Mashable Margaret Simon, almost twelve, has just moved from New York City to the suburbs, and she’s anxious to fit in with her new friends. When she’s asked to join a secret club she jumps at the chance. But when the girls start talking about boys, bras, and getting their first periods, Margaret starts to wonder if she’s normal. There are some things about growing up that are hard for her to talk about, even with her friends. Lucky for Margaret, she’s got someone else to confide in . . . someone who always listens.
