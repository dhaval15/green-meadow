# The Anatomy Of Motive
##### Description
Legendary FBI profiling pioneer John Douglas's theory is that once you figure out the motivating force driving a perpetrator, you've got a good chance of cracking the case. In THE ANATOMY OF MOTIVE he uses cases from his own career to illustrate his argument. He takes us further than ever before into the dark corners of the minds of arsonists, hijackers, serial and spree killers and mass murderers. THE ANATOMY OF MOTIVE analyses such diverse killers as Lee Harvey Oswald and Timothy McVeigh - and helps us learn to anticipate potential violent behaviour before it's too late.
