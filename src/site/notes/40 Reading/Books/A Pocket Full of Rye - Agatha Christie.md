# A Pocket Full of Rye
##### Description
In this ingeniously plotted Christie classic, a child's nursery rhyme holds three clues to find a cunning killer when a well-to-do household becomes infested with murder. The shocking thing about Rex Fortescue's murder was that the contemptible tycoon wasn't knocked off sooner. But when two less-deserving souls fall prey to a killer, Miss Jane Marple feels the need to investigate. The only link appears to be buried in a not-so-innocent verse. So, what's the rhyme or reason behind the playful hint? The answer draws the shrewd sleuth into the heart of a family secret -- and an increasingly menacing game that's anything but child's play.
