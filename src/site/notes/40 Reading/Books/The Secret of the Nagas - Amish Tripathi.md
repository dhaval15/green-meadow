##### Description
At a crucial moment after the cliffhanger ending of book one, The Immortals of Meluha, the warrior-hero Shiva--the man who is the prophesied Neelkanth, or destroyer of evil--is fighting to protect his wife Sati from an invasion by the Nagas, a mysterious militaristic society. Evil forces are growing in strength all around the conflict, and Shiva's own philosopher-guides have betrayed his unquestioning faith by accepting aid from the dark side. Even the idyllic empire of Meluha hides a terrible secret. Accompanied by his troop of warriors, Shiva travels East to the land of Branga in hopes of discovering clues as to the whereabouts of the Naga people. The journey concludes in the Naga capital of Panchavati, where a surprise awaits him that will change the balance of power...
